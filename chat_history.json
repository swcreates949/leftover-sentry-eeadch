You want to create a \"Leftover Tracker\" app using React Native and Expo 54. Here's a plan to get started:\n\n**Features for the First Version:**\n\n-   A home screen displaying a list of leftovers currently in the fridge, including the food name and the date it was put in the fridge.\n-   An \"Add Leftover\" screen where users can input the name of the leftover and the date it was placed in the fridge.\n-   A detail screen for each leftover, showing the name, date added, and a calculated \"days remaining\" until it should be tossed.\n\n**Design Elements:**\n\n*   **Colors:**\n    *   Background: `#f0f4f7` (Light gray)\n    *   Text: `#2d3436` (Dark gray)\n    *   TextSecondary: `#747d8c` (Medium gray)\n    *   Primary: `#29abe2` (Light blue)\n    *   Secondary: `#f778ba` (Pink)\n    *   Accent: `#ffda79` (Yellow)\n    *   Card: `#ffffff` (White)\n    *   Highlight: `#c7ecee` (Very light blue)\n*   **Typography:** Use a modern, clean font like \"System\" for a readable and user-friendly experience.\n\nHere's the plan for the coding agent:\n\n1.  Create a new screen in the `app/(tabs)` directory called `leftovers.tsx`. This will be the home screen displaying the list of leftovers.\n2.  Create a new screen in the `app` directory called `addLeftover.tsx`. This will be the \"Add Leftover\" screen.\n3.  Create a new screen in the `app` directory called `leftoverDetail.tsx`. This will be the detail screen for each leftover.\n4.  Modify the `FloatingTabBar.tsx` file to include a tab for the `leftovers.tsx` screen.\n5.  Implement the UI for each of these screens, using the colors and typography specified above.\n6.  Implement the logic for adding, displaying, and calculating the \"days remaining\" for each leftover.\n7.  Remove the modalDemos array from app/(tabs)/(home)/index.tsx.\n\nLet's create an elegant and functional mobile app!\n"}, {"type": "role_transition", "from_role": "planner", "to_role": "coder", "timestamp": "2025-11-13T19:01:04.908932"}, {"type": "text", "text": "I'll help you build a Leftover Tracker app!
